  title: About Two Parts Heart, One Part Obsession (H2O)
  subtitle: Coach Jenny
  body: Coach Jenny grew up in Texas where she began swimming as a tadpole. She
    continued her swim career all the way through high school where she played
    water polo and was on the dive team for Sterling High School. She moved with
    her family to Kingwood Texas in 2012 and had her first experience with NWAL
    with the Forest Cove Frogs, where her children were swimmers. She began
    coaching at NEHA and then coached the Tidal Wave team for Blue Tide Aquatics
    in 2015, both year round USA competition teams. <br /><br /> She has worked
    as a certified swim instructor teaching children and adults to swim at the
    YMCA in Kingwood. She also developed and started a program while there for
    home schooled swimming families, under the instruction of Kim Kelly and co
    coach Jan Preston. She was responsible for instruction groups of kids from
    beginners to advance, both stroke development and technique as well as water
    safety. Coach Jenny also taught private lessons in the community for both
    learn to swim and stroke improvement. Her credentials include USA swim, SI
    and CPR certified. She finds such joy in watching swimmers meet their own
    goals and expectations, while bringing excitement and fun to the kids. <br
    /><br /> Coach Jenny has three fish of her own, Jacie - 18, Cole - 16, and
    Sadie - 12. They are all excited to be here in Utah to enjoy and adapt in
    their new community. She hopes her passion for the sport of swimming will
    show through to the swimmers and parents.

      description: I couldn’t be happier with the progress my kids made with Coach
        Jenny. She met my kids where they were and taught them what they needed
        to know to be water safe. I had complete beginners work with her and
        kids who have some basics, but nothing more. She was able to work with
        each of them to start and to excel their swimming skills. I have one
        child who is tough to crack and Coach Jenny did! She made my kids feel
        comfortable in the water and to love it. It’s been a year since we took
        lessons from her and my kids still ask to swim with Coach Jenny. We
        couldn’t have asked for a better swimming experience.

      description: Jenny Morris was a very well respected swim coach when we joined
        the South Woodland Hills Wahoos in Kingwood Texas.  It was the first
        year that our children had been a part of a swim team and we were
        anxious if our child would stick with the program.  Our daughter
        immediately took to Jenny and her methods of teaching a younger child
        the basics of swimming.  After the first year of swim team, we then
        approached Jenny about private lessons to give our daughter a leg up on
        the next swim season.  We saw huge improvements with her strokes and
        confidence in the water. We would highly recommend Jenny Morris to
        anyone as a swim coach and personal swim lessons.
